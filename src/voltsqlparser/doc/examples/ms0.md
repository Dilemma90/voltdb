# Purpose
This milestone is not really code related.  It's just to make sure that
the tools work well together.  To do this we define some very simple kinds
of SQL grammars, and make sure that antlr is (1) installed and (2) works
to generate parse trees.  There are no junit tests associated with this
milestone.

# Acceptance Criteria.
1. Manual demonstration of some kind of parse tree.
1. Documentation of the installation procedure and all of the installation parts.
